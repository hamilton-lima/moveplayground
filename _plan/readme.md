# Plan
## Current 

### First version
- Video preview
- Single Skeleton detection
- Blow green balloons game
- Deploy game moveplayground.com

### Next steps 
- Multiplayer Video and audio
    - Should we use Vanila WebRTC to start?
    - Can video rendering be intercepted so the solution to draw the game can be video agnostic?
- Pong multiplayer
