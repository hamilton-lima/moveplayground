- Created the initial application using expo, interesting that created the application as a sub folder of the `react` folder I created to the application... I can live with that ðŸ˜Š
- First fork in the road! what UI library to use, talking to the oracle got to some candidates React Native Paper and NativeBase, to avoid me choosing dying technologies again... Yeap Herval, I am learning hahaha, did some digging on researches https://results.2023.stateofreactnative.com/component-libraries/ and what a surprise React Native Paper is widely used. I guess I have a champion.
- Ops the boilerplate application created from Expo is really complicated, at least for now, will wipe it and restart with React Native Paper.. Maybe there are some boilerplates WITH React Native Paper
