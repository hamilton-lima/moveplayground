# migrating the existing angular app to react, step by step notes 13-oct-2024

## goals
- I18N

## summary 
- goal acomplished! I18N implemented, `use client` was kinda tricky, lets see how it behaves with the static generation of the page
- next step static generate the page
- add calibration screen and the first game ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ‘»


https://locize.com/blog/next-app-dir-i18n/ The next translation with the lang in the route
felt like way too much magic happening... ðŸª„ðŸª„

Looking at the comparison below https://formatjs.io/ seems to be widely used as well.
https://npmtrends.com/next-i18next-vs-react-i18next-vs-react-intl-vs-react-localize-redux

lets go with https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/

What is this?
```
      <IntlProvider
        messages={messages[lang as keyof typeof messages]}
        locale={lang}
      >
```      
Hummmm the `string` lang must be in the list of keys from the type definition of `message`
that is defined like this: 
```
export const messages = {
  en,
  "pt-BR": ptBR,
};
```
