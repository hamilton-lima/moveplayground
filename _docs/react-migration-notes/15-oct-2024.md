## goals
- next step static generate the page
- add calibration screen and the first game ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ‘»

## report
Way too many issues trying to force next to render client side only, this was a mistake! ğŸ’€
Reverting to use Next.js as it was designed to be used, server side rendering as much as possible.
Deployment done at https://moveplayground.vercel.app/en

Let's see if I still have brain power to add the calibration screen... ğŸ§
